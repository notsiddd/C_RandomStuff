Learnt quad trees through this video by thinking of it as terrain in a game (basically a map)

We do it by dividing the space n number of times.

Explanation:

this tree, each node has maximum four children.

We can build a quadtree from a two-dimensional area implementing the following steps

The current two dimensional space is divided into four boxes.
If a box consists of one or more points in it, build a child object, storing in it the two dimensional space of the box.
If a box does not contain any points, do not build a child for it.
Perform recursion for each of the children.
Quadtrees are implemented in image compression, where each node consists of the average colour of each of its children.

The deeper we visit in the tree, the more the detail of the image.

Quadtrees are also implemented in searching for nodes in a two-dimensional area. For instance, if we wanted to compute the closest point to given coordinates, we can do it implementing quadtrees.
